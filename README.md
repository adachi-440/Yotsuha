# yotsuha - a common interface for messaging protocols

## Summry

User and developer friendly NFT bridge.Users can bridge NFT without paying for gas. Developers can develop multiple messaging protocols with a common interface.

### Problems
There are two challenges: the user's problem and the developer's issue.

Gas prices are a serious problem for mass adoption. Now, lots of people can easily get NFT even if they don't have a crypto. However, if they cannot pay for gas, they cannot take advantage of the utility of NFT.

Developers also have problems with cross-chain development. Each cross-chain messaging protocol has a different interface, so each must be implemented by reading the docs, which is time-consuming.

### Solution
Yotsuha is a user- and developer-friendly product.

First, we provide a gasless solution. Users can bridge NFT without paying for gas.

Second, we provide a common interface for messaging protocols.
Developers can easily and quickly implement contracts using multiple messaging protocols.

## Future Work
In the future, we would like to make it more useful by supporting more messaging protocols.

It also provides aggregation between messaging. For example, it compares gas prices and transaction speeds, and auto selects and executes the messaging protocol that best suits the user.
